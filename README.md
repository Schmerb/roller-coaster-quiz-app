# Roller Coaster Quiz-App 
A project from [Thinkful's](https://www.thinkful.com/) fullstack web development program based on roller coaster and theme park facts.

Here is the original prompt for the assignment:

# Project Requirements

## User experience requirements
The following requirements cover what the app must do, from the user's perspective.

* Users start on a screen where they can click a button to start the quiz.

* Once the game is started, the user should be prompted through a series of at least 5 multiple choice questions which they can        answer. Questions are to be asked one after another, and the user should only be able to view one question at a time.

* Users should not be able to skip questions.

* When viewing an individual question, the user should also be able to see which question they're on (for instance, "7 out of 10") and     their current score ("5 correct, 2 incorrect").

* When a user submits an answer to a question, they should first get feedback on if their answer was correct or not. If it's incorrect,   they should be shown the correct answer. Then they should be moved along to the next question.

* After the user has completed the final question, they should be shown their overall score (in other words, how many questions they got   right out of the total questions asked) and be able to start a new game.


## Process requirements

* Before you write code, you'll need to gather content for your app. That means typing up the questions you'll ask and gathering any       images or icons you'll need in your app.

* You'll initially design your app using HTML wireframes, which are HTML (and minimal CSS) only versions of the different screens in       your app. We'll discuss HTML wireframes more in the next assignment.

* Using your HTML wireframes as your starting point, you'll fully implement your app, using JavaScript and jQuery for the application     logic, and writing CSS to make your app look good.


## Technical requirements
Your quiz app must:

* use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery
* be responsive
* follow basic accessibility best practices
* work (this may go without saying, but...)
